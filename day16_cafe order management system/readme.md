This C program simulates a simple Café Order Management System.
It allows up to 10 customers to place orders from 5 fixed menu items — Coffee, Tea, Sandwich, Burger, and Pastry — each with set prices.

The program:

Displays the café menu with item numbers and prices.

Takes multiple customer orders with item numbers and quantities.

Calculates and displays each customer’s total bill.

Tracks how many of each item were sold and the total revenue.

After all orders, shows a summary including:

Total revenue of the day

Total items sold

Most ordered item

Least ordered item

It uses 1D arrays, loops, and conditional statements only — no functions, pointers, or structures.
