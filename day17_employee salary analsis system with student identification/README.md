This C program implements an Employee Salary Analysis System focused on practicing fundamental programming concepts. It collects and stores salaries for up to 10 employees in a one-dimensional array. The program includes a menu-driven interface allowing the user to perform several analyses:Display all employee salaries.Calculate and display total and average salaries.Identify the highest and lowest salaries.Count employees whose salaries are above or below the average.Sort and display salaries in ascending order using bubble sort.The program also captures student identification details (name, registration number, and section) and displays these with every output to ensure unique submissions. The code emphasizes the use of basic constructs like arrays, loops, conditional statements, and simple sorting without the use of functions or advanced data structures. It validates inputs such as limiting the number of employees to 10 and handles input string formatting carefully. This program serves as a practical exercise in applying C programming fundamentals to real-world inspired tasks with interactive user engagement.
